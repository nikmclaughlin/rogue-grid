# Rogue Grid

**[WIP] A minimalist dungeon-crawler that plays on an 8x8 CSS grid.**

Your goal is simple: navigate your way to the exit of each level. But plan carefully! Every step takes a toll on you, and powerful enemies will stand in your way. Youâ€™ll need to conserve your energy to take them down. Use the dungeon loot to give yourself an extra boost as you make your way to the exit!

**Features [in-progress]**

- Infinite procedurally-generated mini dungeon levels
- Frontend built with React and vanilla CSS
- Backend exploration of complex data structures
- Local high scores
- Additional enemy types
